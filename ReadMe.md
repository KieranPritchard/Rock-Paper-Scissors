## Project Description

This project is a simple rock, paper, scissors game. While playing this game allows the user to go up againist a computer player, also during the game is being played both players score is tracked by the code.

For this project I used Python, this was because I was using this project as a way to practice using the langauge. things I practiced included:

* While loops.
* Condiditional statments.
* Importing external modules, for this project the `import random` module.
* Changing varible values as the program is run.

I didn't really come across any challenges however, I did have trouble setting up the while loop and conditionals. I overcame this by setting the main bulk of the program inside a while loop set to true, as well as using a mix of and/or statments in the if statements to streamline the code.
