## Project Description

This project is a simple rock, paper, scissors game. While playing this game allows the user to go up againist a computer player, also during the game is being played both players score is tracked by the code.

For this project I used Python, this was because I was using this project as a way to practice using the langauge. things I practiced included:

* While loops.
* Condiditional statments.
* Importing external modules, for this project the `import random` module.
* Changing varible values as the program is run.

I didn't really come across any challenges however, I did have trouble setting up the while loop and conditionals. I overcame this by setting the main bulk of the program inside a while loop set to true, as well as using a mix of and/or statments in the if statements to streamline the code.

## How to Use the Project

1. **Clone The Repository:**

    This saves the code to your local device.

2. **Run The Game**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have         stored the code. To run the code input this in the terminal:
   `python Rock_Paper_Scissors.py`

3.  **Play The Game**

   * When your prompted, enter your choice: `Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`.
   * To stop playing, input `Quit`.

4. **Game Rules**

    * The computer player will randomly choose between Rock, Paper, Scissors.
    * The game then compares choices to determine a winner:
        * Rock breaks Scissors
        * Scissors cuts Paper
        * Paper wraps Rock
    * The game will keep track of scores for both the user and the computer.
  
5. **End The Game**

   When `Quit` is entered, the game displays the final scores for that session and stops the program.
